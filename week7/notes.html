        <h3>Ch11: Further Functions</h3>
        <paragraph>
        this.name can be any variable passed into a function <br>
        Basic object usage <br>
        You can call the data from the cache of a computer <br>
        temp variables do not exist out of its scope <br>
        Initialization only need to be done once to an object <br>
        This function rewrites itself; <br>
        <pre>
          function party(){
            console.log('Wow this is amazing!');
            party = function(){
            console.log('Been there, got the T-Shirt');
            }
          }
        </pre>
        A callback goes back to its original instance <br>
        callback hell is when callbacks get way to tangled <br>
        Promise is a futrue result. It is used with asynchronous operations <br>
        promises have resolve() and reject() that initializes the code <br>
        async is placed in front of a function to make it asynchronous <br> 
        Functions can return functions. I have no idea why that would be used? <br>
        </paragraph>

        <h3>Ch13: AJAX</h3>
        <paragraph>
        AJAX means asynchronous JavaScript XML <br>
        Fetch uses an api and uses .then to perform the response <br>
        .then can use a lambda function <br>
        Response can redirect to a different URL (response.redirect(URL) <br>
        response.text() can be used to convert data to a string <br>
        response.json() changes into a js object <br>
        There are response objects <br>
        HTTP methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE <br>
        Headers are headers for the response or request <br>
        Liging Standard; <br>
        <pre>
          $.ajax('http://numbersapi.com/random')
          .done(text => outputDiv.innerHTML = text );
        </pre>
